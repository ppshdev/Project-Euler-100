### Even Fibonacci numbers

#### Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

My first thoughts here are to create two arrays. The first array will create the fib sequence normally, then the second array will contain the first ten even numbers that are generated.

#### How do I go about that?
